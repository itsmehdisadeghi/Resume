# Mehdi Sadeghi | Embedded AI Engineer

### Embedded Systems Specialist & AI Developer

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate Embedded Engineer with over 6 years of experience in electronics and computer science. My journey has led me to a deep specialization in **Embedded AI**, where I bridge the gap between low-level hardware control and high-level intelligent algorithms. I thrive on creating innovative solutions, from autonomous drones to smart edge devices.
